## Description

- This is a problem presented by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight//), with a twist to the project added on by me, personally

Given a square chessboard of N x N size, the position of Knight and position of a target is given. We need to find out minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position.

Examples: <br/>
![EXAMPLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darman84/Minimum-Knight-Moves/master/EXAMPLE.PNG)

In above diagram Knight takes 3 step to reach  from (4, 5) to (1, 1) (4, 5) -> (5, 3) -> (3, 2)  -> (1, 1)  as shown in diagram

**Additional**: Using OpenGL, create an illustration of the path that your knight takes to reach the target
